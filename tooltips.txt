# component name	tooltip
Button_vendor_raw	Extract data directly from Waters or Agilent raw files (.raw or .d). 
Button_raw_file	Select text (_raw.csv) files to analyze. ***NOTE: automated converters to generate _raw.csv files from raw data are available - see manual for details***
Button_analysis_file	Select previously processed .ciu files to load for analysis. Files will be displayed in the table below
Entry_start_files	"To process only some files in the table above, enter the number corresponding to the beginning of the range of files to analyze. Must be an integer value only"
Entry_end_files	"To process only some files in the table above, enter the number corresponding to the end of the range of files to analyze. Must be an integer value only"
Button_change_outputdir	"Select a new directory in which to save output files, including .ciu files. By default, this is set to the directory from which files in the table were loaded."
Button_plot_options	Use this button to change the output plot settings for ALL plots generated by all the different analysis types. 
Button_crop	"Crop CIU data in one or both axes. A popup window will open to input crop dimensions. To undo, use the Restore Original Data button."
Button_smooth	Change how the data are smoothed. NOTE: this smoothing is performed IN ADDITION TO previous smoothing. Use 'restore original data' to smooth fresh from the raw data
Button_interpolate	Interpolate either or both axes of the CIU data. Interpolation is done by a provided factor (e.g. a factor of 2 means the axis will have twice the number of points as it did originally)
Button_restore_raw	"Clears ALL previous processing, cropping, and analysis (feature detection, gaussian fitting, etc) from a .ciu file, restoring the original raw data."
Button_print_params	Print all parameters from each file in the table to the console window for viewing. 
Button_default_params	Save current parameter settings to be the default values. These values will be remembered the next time the software opens.
Button_gaussian_fit	Perform Gaussian fitting on the ciu files loaded in the table. NOTE: You may have to adjust the default peak widths to match the expected resolution of your instrument and analyte - see the manual details.
Button_gaussian_reconstruct	Generate a NEW ciu file from Gaussian fit results from feature detection or from a template file. See manual for details.
Button_plot	Generate a CIU fingerprint plot for each currently loaded file (in the files table)
Button_compare	"Perform RMSD comparison of CIU datasets. Note: If ONLY 1 file is loaded in the table, it will be used as a standard to compare against a list of chosen files. Otherwise, all files in the table will be compared against all other files."
Button_average	Average selected fingerprints in the table above to form a new .ciu file with the averaged data. Intended only for replicate analyses of the same data.
Button_feature_detect	Perform feature detection on the loaded files. See manual for a description of how to choose appropriate parameters for feature detection. 
Button_ciu50	Perform CIU50 analysis on the loaded files. NOTE: files must have Feature Detection performed first before CIU50.
Button_build_classification	"Create a new classification scheme to compare several groups of CIU data. In this mode, you provide known ""standards"" that represent a particular type of CIU fingerprint (a ""class"" or group). "
Button_classify_unknown	"Classify the loaded .ciu files in the table against a classification scheme. You will be prompted to select the classification scheme file (.clf) previously created with the ""Build classification"" button. "
Button_about	Open the about file
Button_help	Open the CIUSuite 2 manual (PDF)
Button_Cutoff	"Cutoff signals if they fall below a percentage from the maximun signal intensity. Unable to undo with restore button. However, it keeps a copy of the original file. Also corrects Agilent decimal voltages (set cutoff to zero to only do this task)."
